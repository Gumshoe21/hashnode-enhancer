# Hashnode Enhancer

A Google Chrome extension that supplements your Hashnode experience.

# What/who is this extension for?

This extension has a very simple goal: provide a reader of a Hashnode article with supplementary reading material and other resources (YouTube videos, courses to take, etc.) based on the topic(s) being discussed.

# Project Journal

For this project, I'm keeping a [journal](project-journal.md) that will keep track of all my problems and struggles faced during the development of this extension.
